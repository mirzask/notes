*** (baseline Cr: ***)
- Definition: increase in Cr by 0.3 mg/dL w/in 48 hrs or increase to 1.5 times
baseline w/in 7d or urine volume < 0.5 cc/kg/hr for 6+ hrs

## Nephrotic Range Proteinuria

### Work-up

```
Workup of Nephrotic Range Proteinuria:
- Urine protein : creatinine ratio
- A1C
- TSH
- HIV, RPR
- HCV, HBV serologies
- Lipid profile
- SPEP/SFLC
 
Other tests routinely sent but should really be history driven: ANA, C3, C4,
anti-dsDNA, cryoglobulins, ASO
Renal ultrasound: important in the outpatient setting if unexplained reason for
proteinuria/CKD; helps to identify physical abnormalities (such as solitary
kidney, multiple renal cysts, small kidneys) which would make renal biopsy
contraindicated
Referral to renal for biopsy!! Usually warranted in adults if proteinuria
persistent and etiology unclear!
