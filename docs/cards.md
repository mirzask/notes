## Heart Failure

### Note

```
Acute (on chronic?) systolic (or diastolic) dysfunction - 
- Presence of ICD/ppm?
- Last EF?
- Work-up:
       - EKG: 
       - Imaging: CXR, Echo
       - Labs: BNP, Trop
- Preload: IV diuresis - DOSE trial (2.5x home dose), TDD of home diuretic x2 
and give as BID/TID for 48-72 hrx
- Afterload: 
- Neurohormonal: 
- R/R:
- Ischemia: statin, ASA
- Diet: salt-restricted diet. If class D HF, consider FWR
- Labs: monitor lytes; maintain K > 4, Mg > 2
    - BID labs?
- Indication for ICD or CRT?
- If HFrEF and *iron-deficiency* (w/ or w/o anemia) defined as ferritin < 100 or 
ferritin 100-299 + transferrin sat < 20% -> IV iron for functional and Sx 
improvement. Studies of the effect on mortality and hospitalization are ongoing, 
as are studies in pts w/ HFpEF.
- If HFpEF - consider spironolactone if elevated BNP, SGLT2i if T2DM
- Encourage lifestyle modifications and optimize co-morbidities
- Daily standing weights
- Strict I/O
```

### Work-up

- Work-up for _new-onset_ should include:
    - TSH
    - HIV
    - CAD evaluation
    - Substance abuse screening: EtOH, cocaine, methamphetamines
    - If HFpEF + low-voltage EKG, consider amyloidosis
- **BNP** > 100 pg/mL is predictive of HF ( > 200 if AFib)
    - Obesity artificially lowers BNP
    - Elevators of BNP include female, AFib, ACS, LVH, old age, CKD, etc.
- **NT-proBNP** < 300 pg/mL excludes HF
    - Age cutoffs: < 450 pg/mL for < 50 yo, < 900 pg/mL for 50-75 yo, < 1800 pg/mL for > 75 yo
- **EKG**
- **CXR**
- **Echo**
    - RVSP can estimate PA pressure (PASP)
        - consider possibility of Pulm HTN in those w/ RVSP > 40 mmHg + dyspnea (ACC/AHA)

### Medications

- **Beta-blockers**: metoprolol XL, carvedilol, bisoprolol
- **ACEi/ARB**
- **ARNI** - sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto)
    - PARADIGM-HF trial: ARNI 20% RR reduction vs ACEi
    - stop ACEi 24-36 hrs prior to initiation
    - lower/stop other diuretics upon initiation (b/c sacubitril's diuretic effect)
    - start at lowest dose and titrate up every 2-4 wks
    - Consider initiation during hospitalization for ADHF [PIONEER-HF trial]
- **Diuretics**
    - **Loops**, such as Lasix, Bumex, Torsemide
        - Conversions: 40 mg PO Lasix = 20 mg PO torsemide = 1 mg Bumex
        - Lasix dosing:
            - BUN x 2
            - House of God - BUN + age
            - Joel Topf - Cr x 20
        - Dosing during *acute episode* - $\text{home dose} \times 2$ in IV form administered BID/TID for 48-72hrs (Clyde Yancy)
            - DOSE trial - no diff b/w continuous diuresis vs intermittent IV boluses
    - **Aldosterone antagonists**
        - CrCl > 30 + K < 5
        - useful in HFpEF pts w/ elevated BNP
        - start at 12.5 mg daily w/ repeat K, Cr in 1 week
    - **Metolazone** can take > 24 hrs for the effect to be seen (Dr. Ooi)
- **SGLT2i** (e.g. dapagliflozin)
    - DAPA-HF trial
- **IV iron** [FAIR-HF trial]
    - if iron-deficiency +/- anemia
        - ferritin < 100 *or* ferritin 100-299 + Tsat < 20% to improve functional status and QoL
    - oral iron replacement is not effective [IRONOUT-HF trial]

### Other recommendations

- **Lifestyle modifications**:
    - Less than 2L fluid or 2g salt per day
    - Cardiac rehab
- Sleep apnea?
